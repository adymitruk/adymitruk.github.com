      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;minecraft&#34; src=&#34;../../images/minecraft.png&#34; style=&#34;float:left;margin:0 10px 10px 0&#34; markdown=&#34;0&#34; /&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing minecraft a couple of nights a week for about 40 minutes each time with my son. This seems to be a trend even for very young children. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t too long before I found myself running a server so that we could play together with our friends (We even setup a trello board for our missions and projects!). It&amp;rsquo;s much more fun to work together and build something. Discovering new places and building contraptions, houses and other things is very stimulating for a young mind - as well as my old mind. This generation has so much more at their disposal.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
