After a long hiatus, I'm starting to blog again.

It's been over a decade since my last post, and a lot has changed. The world has evolved, technology has leaped forward, and I've had countless experiences worth sharing. But some things remain constant — the value of writing down your thoughts, sharing knowledge, and connecting with others who are navigating similar challenges.

## Event Modeling's Journey

Since introducing [Event Modeling](https://eventmodeling.org/) in 2018, I've watched it grow from a workshop technique into a global methodology used by teams worldwide. What started as a way to bridge communication between developers and domain experts has become a fundamental approach to designing information systems.

Event Modeling continues to evolve. Recently, I had the opportunity to explore **Dynamic Consistency Boundaries** in a fireside chat with Martin Thompson and Allard Buijze from AxonIQ — diving deep into how consistency boundaries work in event-sourced systems and why they're fundamentally different from traditional aggregate or stream boundaries.

The conversation covered why traditional bounded contexts often feel wrong, how event sourcing lets boundaries emerge naturally from workflows rather than upfront design, and why this approach is especially powerful when working with AI systems.

## Adaptech Group: A Decade of Innovation

This year also marks the **10-year anniversary** of [Adaptech Group](https://adaptechgroup.com/), the collective I founded to bring together top technologists focused on event-centric architecture. Over the past decade, we've helped organizations around the world implement Event Modeling and Event Sourcing, proving that these patterns scale from startups to global enterprises.

## What to Expect

You can still find the old version of this blog at dymitruk.com, but this new iteration at blog.dymitruk.com is where I'll be posting going forward with:

- Technical deep dives on event sourcing, distributed systems, and software architecture
- Reflections on building great software with simple, pragmatic solutions
- The occasional tangent into whatever's captured my curiosity

If you've been following along since the early days — welcome back. If you're new here — glad to have you.

Let's see where this goes.
