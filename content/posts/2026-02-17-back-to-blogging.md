After a long hiatus, I'm starting to blog again.

It's been over a decade since my last post, and a lot has changed. The world has evolved, technology has leaped forward, and I've had countless experiences worth sharing. But some things remain constant — the value of writing down your thoughts, sharing knowledge, and connecting with others who are navigating similar challenges.

I've migrated the blog to Hugo with the PaperMod theme. The old Octopress setup served me well, but it was time for something cleaner and more maintainable. You can still find the old version at dymitruk.com, but this new iteration at blog.dymitruk.com is where I'll be posting going forward.

What to expect:

- Technical deep dives on event sourcing, distributed systems, and software architecture
- Reflections on building great software with simple, pragmatic solutions
- The occasional tangent into whatever's captured my curiosity

If you've been following along since the early days — welcome back. If you're new here — glad to have you.

Let's see where this goes.
