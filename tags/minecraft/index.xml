&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing minecraft a couple of nights a week for about 40 minutes each time with my son. This seems to be a trend even for very young children. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t too long before I found myself running a server so that we could play together with our friends (We even setup a trello board for our missions and projects!). It&amp;rsquo;s much more fun to work together and build something. Discovering new places and building contraptions, houses and other things is very stimulating for a young mind - as well as my old mind. This generation has so much more at their disposal.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Since the 2 teams don&amp;rsquo;t play very often, it would be nice to get notifications when one goes online so the other can join. The server has a log file that we can inspect. So I came up with this little script that emails the other team when we log in and vice versa. I also made the same for logging off. This is scripting 101, but most people I know are programmers and don&amp;rsquo;t necessarily dabble in bash.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>tail -F /srv/minecraft-server/server.log | 
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> grep --line-buffered &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#39;adymitruk .* logged in&amp;#39;&lt;/span> | 
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">while&lt;/span> read line
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">do&lt;/span> 
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> echo &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;Join me if you can.&amp;#34;&lt;/span> | 
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> mail -s &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;I just logged in to Minecraft&amp;#34;&lt;/span> yourfriend@gmail.com 
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">done&lt;/span> &amp;amp;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>The minecraft log makes it easy to take actions according to what happens in the game. A line gets written saying who logged in and who logged out. Tailing this log and then grepping for those lines, we can send an email. Here&amp;rsquo;s how you can &lt;a href="http://ubuntu-tutorials.com/2008/11/11/relaying-postfix-smtp-via-smtpgmailcom/">set up your server to send via gmail&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
