&lt;p>Last week I was lucky enough to present and attend the Norwegian Developer Conference in Oslo. This was a wonderful event with many excellent presentations and post conference get-togethers. The highlight of this conference for me was the announcement that &lt;a href="http://www.continuoustests.com">Continuous Tests aka Mighty Moose&lt;/a> is now free! If you&amp;rsquo;ve been keeping up with the conference on twitter, you may have noticed the controversy that the Azure announcement caused. I also didn&amp;rsquo;t like the use of profanity in the keynote and more mentions of Steve Jobs, but that&amp;rsquo;s a small part. Aral had me in stitches with all the usability (or there lack of) issues found in our world. My criticism of those 2 things caused Aral to block me on Twitter - I guess some people have thin skin. Don&amp;rsquo;t let the Azure slip up take away from an excellent conference. Download all the presentations and watch them.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
